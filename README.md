🏗️ Design Optimization from Contour Points

📌 Overview
This project focuses on design optimization by extracting and refining contour points from an image. The approach uses image processing, curve fitting, and optimization techniques to improve the shape representation while maintaining key design constraints.

✨ Features
Extracts contour points from an input image.
Fits a smooth parametric curve to approximate the contour.
Uses optimization techniques to refine the shape.
Provides a visual comparison of original vs. optimized contours.

📂 Project Structure
Main Script:
Executes the contour extraction and optimization process.
Requirements File:
